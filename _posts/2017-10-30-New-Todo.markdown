# Monday



It's been a little slow going this past week. Life has been keeping me very active...also I've been feeling slightly lazy....so there is that.

ANYWAY. Finished my first todo app today. Went through the course walkthrough step by step this time instead of jumping ahead...made it so I could actually get through without feeling drained or frustrated because I did something that works...but is not where the course is going. It's not a great todo app...it doesn't save tasks...so no persistance...but as far as front end stuff goes it was a good tutorial. I feel like I could make it by myself if I did it again...might do that...we'll see. I really like the simplicity that jQuery adds to Javascript...makes it much quicker to work stuff out.

Anyway..if you want to check out the todo progress, it's listed below.
