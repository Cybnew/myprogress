## The plague has passed.

It took all damn week but I am finally over the stupid cold I had. Being sick really took it out of me this week, so I pretty much avoided anything programming related beyond a youtube video or two.. But...since I am FINALLY feeling better, I figured I would dig deep into the rest of the basic javascript section. What does that mean?

Well...I finally finished the RGB color guessing game from the Udemy Course. It usually takes me about 35 minutes to complete a 15 minute video. Usually it's because I pause it right before the instructor explains it, and I try to figure it out for myself. I have mixed feelings on the benifits of this. 

A. It gets me thinking about how to solve the problem...which is good. I have gotten in the habit of separating my code out (I guess it counts as refactoring) before the instructor finishes explaining a way to solve the problem.
2. But it gets me pointed down a path (branch?) that diverts from the course, which is fine...but if the course takes a slightly different direction, it takes me for forever to redirect my code towards the solution. Urg.

Tonight things went pretty damn well up until the final refactoring. I spent 21 minutes searching for what happened to be a comma that escapted the file...I could have sworn it was there when I started. Unfortunately, while I was searching for what turned out to be a missing comma, Katy was busy searching through her sewing patterns...we learned that I don't focus well with crinkling craft paper in the background. **looks at Katy**

Anyway. RGB game is finished. If you want to check it out you can click the link below.

Tomorrow I start with jQuery. 

Will post more soon.
