# Saturday....

Well today I finally finished watching the solution video for the score counter. My solution was mostly spot on, however for styling of the winning characters, the course used a toggle function instead of setting the color in a style and resetting it to a specific color on reset.

Also learned about mousover and mouse leave to change the color on a hover state.

Key takeaways for me

* HTML is the structure
* CSS is the style
* Javascript is the actions

NOUN ADJECTIVE VERB

So, when working on functionality, use HTML to build the frame, style it with CSS, and use javascript to manipulate the CSS instead of the HTML itself.

Also got a preview for the new project I will be working on. An RGB Color guessing game. Seems complex, but it has a lot of features I need to learn, such as responsive layout and more stylistic design.
