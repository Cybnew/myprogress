# This is kinda frustrating

It's taken me at *least* an hour to figure out why these posts aren't working right with jekyll...but luckily, if you are viewing it, I have figured it out.

## Right now this is where my programming knowledge is.

* HTML - Basic knowledge. Can create simple static pages with standard tags.
* CSS - can create stylesheets and tie them back to my pages. This and HTML has come very naturally to me.
* Javascript - This is where I'm currently working. Can create variables, objects, loops, conditional statements, functions. Some simple DOM manipulation. Last night I created an application that tracks scores of players, Accepts a max score and allows players to reset their progress. 
* Git process. How to operate git from the command line and how to manage files and branches.

## Where I wan't to go next

After my javascript module I plan to work on (roughly in this order)

* jQuery
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* MySql
* React.JS
* Ruby
* Rails
* Python
* Django


I know it's a lot to take in. I don't necessarly want to become proficient in any of these languages right away, but I do want to at least get a little overview of how they work.

## How I'm Learning

Right now I'm following a UDEMY.com course "The Complete Web Developer Course" which is based around Node. I also have one based on Rails.

Lynda.com fills in the gaps in the material that UDEMY skips over.

After that I have the books.

Javascript for the absolute beginner is what I'm currently reading and it's doing a good job of reinforcing stuff I have learned.

and **finally** YouTube.

Lately I've been watching videos from Mackenzie Child (great for design as well as coding) and from DevTips.

## In conclusion

I hope to update this with a post after every project...possibly every day I work on my courses...which at this rate is just about daily. 

### What does this mean?

It means there are going to be a LOT of posts. It means there is going to be a lot of bullshit. It means there will be spelling errors, shitty code, and utter confusion. But hopefully it will also mean there will be a lot of progress.
