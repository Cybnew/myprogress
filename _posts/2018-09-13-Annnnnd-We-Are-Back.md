# Thursday

Well...I stopped studying for a while. Bouncing mental images had me jumping from language to language. Well...I'm unemployed right now...so I need to make money. I am working on catching back up to where I was before I jumped off.

I've taken up following the Odin Project, so I will combine that with the courses I have on udemy...those will be the only two main sources for right now. Once I finish those I will try to apply for a local job as either a full-stack web developer or a front-end developer. 

I will probably be making a few sites as a demonstration of my skills along the way.

Ideas I have for a projects?

* A website that details the evolution of the Porche 911
* An E-Commerce Store
* A social based experience for motorcycle trips


Anyway...will continue to work on these ideas.
