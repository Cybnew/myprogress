Well..this weekend was long and full of terrors...

## Fact: The days of 24 hour video game playing has passed. No longer am I able to withstand the clock's torment as the seconds turn to minutes, and the minutes turn to hours.
This weekend Katy hosted a 24 hour video game livestream for the ExtraLife organization. The goal was to raise money for childrens hospitals...and that involved us playing video games for 24 hours. I was not required to participate...but I did so anyway...well..for 22.5 of them...I ended up taking an hour and a half nap....totally worth it.

Anyway...with the livestream requiring a hefty amount of setup, I was not able to study friday-sunday....so I accomplished nothing.

Today I could barely suffer through a few lessons...but did learn about post requests. I was able to code along and make a page that updates with information from a text box....dont know if I could do it from memory...but I could figure it out I think.

Tomorrow...we go deeper.
