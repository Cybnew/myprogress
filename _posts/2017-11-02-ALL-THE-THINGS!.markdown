HOLY LIGHTSPEED BATMAN!

This week has been a blitz on the coursework...I know I havn't updated this much...but I have been super deep in the learnings.

When last we left off I had just coded a front end "app" that was a basic todo list...which was awesome...but the todo's were not persistant...well since then...guess what!?!?!

Are you thinking that now they might be persistant? If so than you are....

## Wrong!

Yeah...I haven't touched the todo list app since I published the last post...but here is what I have done...

I have set up a cloud9 IDE...I intend to install Node on a Raspberry pi at somepoint...but until then...cloud9 handles that hassle which lets me focus on the learning.

Tuesday...halloween...got a little done. Learned about Node.js and how it works on the serverside.

* Set up a Node environment.

* Got some more practice using command line commands...I knew most of the ones the course covered...but it is good to get a refresher and some practice using them.

* Learned about the express framework...and about NPM...and installing Node packages.

* Learned about Get requests...and routes...and how to serve info to routes....and how to use variables in them.

* Learned about EJS...or embedded javascript...and how to use EJS to serve a variable to a template page...

All of this has been fairly abstract...and while I feel I could fumble around with this and get a header to display a page name based on an imput in the URL field, I have a feeling it will really start to come together in the next few days so I can generate pages dynamically.

I know this is really rambly..but oh well.
