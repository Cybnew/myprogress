# Wednesday

Slightly dead. Consumed by cold meds. Havn't coded since monday. Head is foggy. 

Plus side...playing around with illustrator...doodling..pretty fun.

Might post some doodles soon.

Thought of project I want to do, simple color scheme generator...with vector graphics being affected by color choices. 

This is rambling....I know...how about a haiku?

Head cold has me sacked-
Sudafed has me loopy-
Time to not be sick.
