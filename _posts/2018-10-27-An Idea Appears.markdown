Okay...So...I Have an idea...A project If you will....something to motivate me and a clear path to get there.

Things I need to do.

1. Create Trello Board For Project
2. Finish refreshing Javascript
3. Build a Visual Mockup
4. Mongo Refresh
5. OATH...Github Integration Initially?
6. Profit...not...you know actually profit...but...emotionally? 
7. #winning?

Okay...so how to I cram this into my busy schedule?

M-F Wake up at 5:30...this means bedtime is....10pm. My goal is to have this prototype completed by New Years Day. 66 days....totally doable.
