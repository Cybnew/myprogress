Okay...soooo here's today's progress.

Refamiliarization with arrays and objects, as well as loops. Now...Loops are where I have struggled in the past...and it's still a bit of a point of friction in the flow and getting the browser to display what I want...but I'm figuring it out. So here is what I'm doing to get to where I need to be employable.

Step 1: The Odin Project...basically a self paced reference based course.
Step 2: Mix in the parts of The Complete Webdeveloper Bootcamp course I have on Udemy.
Step 3: Mix in some youtube and other references I find.
Step 4: Profit?

This weekend has us running a ton of errands but I will try to work on this at least an hour a day.

I'm also going to be working on the mockup for the Porche 911 site I have in mind.
